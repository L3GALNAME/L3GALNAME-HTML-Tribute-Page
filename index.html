        <p>"<b>Robert F. "Toby" Fox</b> (born October 11, 1991) is an American video 
          game developer and composer. He is best known for developing the 
          role-playing video game Undertale, which garnered acclaim and has received 
          nominations for a British Academy Game Award, three Game Awards and D.I.C.E. Awards. 
          He is also the creator and head of the ongoing development of <i>Deltarune</i>, 
          which contains many characters and features <i>from Undertale</i>, and 
          has also garnered significant praise. <br><br>
          Fox's early work consisted primarily of composing music, notably for the 
          webcomic <i>Homestuck</i>, and, following the success of <i>Undertale</i>, 
          he went on to compose music for a number of other indie games. Other notable 
          works include contributing to the soundtracks of <i>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</i> 
          and the <i>Pok√©mon</i> video games." - Wikipedia
